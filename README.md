### Our environment 
* Windows 10
* Python 3.9
* Pytorch 1.8.0
* NVIDIA GPU (GeForce RTX 3080) + CUDA (12.2)

How to install CUDA/Cudnn
https://medium.com/geekculture/install-cuda-and-cudnn-on-windows-linux-52d1501a8805

### Setup
##### 1. Install CUDA
Ensure that CUDA is installed and properly configured for your system.
##### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Set up a Python virtual environment (Python â‰¥ 3.9).
##### 3. Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies, including PyTorch.
   ```
   $ conda create -n tagspark python=3.9
   $ conda activate tagspark
   $ pip install torch==1.8.0+cu111 torchvision==0.9.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.8.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

  
### Training
A sample dataset is available in the datasets folder. Activate the virtual environment and navigate to the project directory before running `demo_train_pipeline.py`. Once completed, you can proceed with training the TAG-SPARK model. To use a custom dataset, update the `datasets_path` variable accordingly.
```
$ conda activate tagspark
$ python demo_train_pipeline.py
```

### Testing
Run `demo_test_pipeline.py` to evaluate the pre-trained model's denoising performance on the sample dataset. To test with your own data and a retrained model, update the `datasets_path` and `denoise_model` variables accordingly.
```
python demo_test_pipeline.py
```

### Param explanation
* demo_train_pipeline.py

```python=11
## %% Select file(s) to be processed

datasets_path = f'datasets/29_4_2_4'  # folder containing tif files for training

# %% First setup some parameters for training
n_epochs = 10               # the number of training epochs
GPU = '0'                   # the index of GPU used for computation (e.g. '0', '0,1', '0,1,2')
pth_dir = './pth'           # pth file and visualization result file path
num_workers = 0             # if you use Windows system, set this to 0.
```


* demo_test_pipeline.py

```python=11
# %% Select file(s) to be processed (download if not present)

datasets_path = f'datasets/29_4_2_4'  # folder containing tif files for testing
denoise_model = f'29_4_2_4_202310260959'  # A folder containing pth models to be tested

# %% First setup some parameters for testing
GPU = '0'                             # the index of GPU used for computation (e.g. '0', '0,1', '0,1,2')
num_workers = 0                       # if you use Windows system, set this to 0.
```
